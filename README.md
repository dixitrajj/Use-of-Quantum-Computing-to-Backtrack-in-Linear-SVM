Quantum-Enhanced Backtracking for Cryptographic State Recovery in Linear SVM-Based Systems

The increasing complexity of cryptographic systems necessitates advanced techniques for state recovery and key analysis, particularly as quantum computing continues to evolve. Classical cryptanalysis methods, while effective in certain cases, often face exponential time complexity when attempting to recover cryptographic states in high-dimensional spaces. The integration of quantum computing in cryptanalysis introduces novel possibilities, particularly through quantum-enhanced search techniques. This project explores Quantum-Enhanced Backtracking (QEB) as a computational strategy to improve cryptographic state recovery in systems utilizing Linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for decision-making processes. Backtracking is a fundamental algorithmic approach used for constraint satisfaction problems, including cryptographic key recovery. However, classical backtracking algorithms often suffer from combinatorial explosion due to the vast number of possible states to explore. Quantum computing, with its inherent ability to process multiple states simultaneously through quantum superposition and entanglement, offers a significant speedup over classical methods. This project focuses on leveraging Groverâ€™s algorithm and quantum-enhanced backtracking heuristics to accelerate the search for cryptographic keys and system states. By integrating quantum techniques, we aim to explore how state recovery can be performed more efficiently, reducing the computational overhead associated with brute-force cryptanalysis. A key component of this work is the incorporation of Linear SVM-based systems into the cryptanalysis framework. Linear SVMs, widely used in classification and decision boundary modelling, provide a structured representation of cryptographic state transitions. By mapping state recovery as an optimization problem within the SVM framework, we can analyse how quantum-enhanced backtracking can effectively navigate decision boundaries to recover encrypted states. The project investigates whether quantum speedups can significantly improve state recovery rates when applied to SVM-based cryptographic models, thereby contributing to the broader field of machine learning-assisted cryptanalysis. The findings from this project will have significant implications for both cryptographic security and post-quantum cryptanalysis. As quantum computing progresses, it is crucial to assess the resilience of existing cryptographic schemes and explore countermeasures against potential quantum attacks. By demonstrating the effectiveness of quantum-enhanced backtracking in cryptographic state recovery, this research contributes to the ongoing efforts in designing quantum-resistant encryption methods. The insights gained from this work can aid in the development of more secure cryptographic protocols, ensuring robust protection against both classical and quantum adversaries.
